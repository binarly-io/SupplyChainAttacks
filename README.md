This repository provides a curated and comprehensive collection of documented firmware supply chain attacks discovered or investigated by Binarly REsearch team. Maintained by Binarly, the project serves as an educational and reference resource for cybersecurity researchers, professionals, and organizations to better understand attack vectors, tactics, and methodologies used in supply chain compromises.

What you’ll find here:
- Detailed information about notable supply chain attack cases
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with these incidents
- Detection tools, references, and documentation to help defenders proactively secure firmnware supply chain components

This repository aims to increase awareness and enable proactive defense strategies to combat the growing risk posed by sophisticated threat actors targeting firmware supply chains.
